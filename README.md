# Oragon.Spring
A .NetStandard 2.0 port of Spring.Net

### This port extends [Spring.NET  2.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-net) adding support to .NET Standard

I'm Luiz Carlos Faria, Spring.NET user. I love this project. I couldn't just and watch the project die, Spring.NET solves many questions and adress many ways to do IoC and Dependency Injection in the right way.

## Goals
A main goal with this port is solve questions about adapt and overcome migration from .NET Framework to .NET Standard. Only core projects will be part of this work.

This port/fork contains only two projects:

### Spring.Core
* A full featured Inversion of Control container
* Expression Language for lightweight scripting

### Spring.AOP
* An Aspect Oriented Programming framework

# Issues

**We have a huge test failures**
